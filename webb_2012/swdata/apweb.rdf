    <ns1:evolution xmlns:ns1="http://apweb.info/sw/ont/">Evolution. Divergence &amp; Distribution. The age of crown group Celastrales was estimated as (87-)81(-75) or( 62-)56(-50) million years (two penalized likelihood dates), the stem group age being (108-)104(-100) and (95-)91(-87) million years; Bayesian relaxed clock estimates were slightly older, to 100 and 112 million years respectively (Wang et al. 2009). Wikström et al. (2001) suggested an age for stem Celastrales of some (92-)89(-86) million years, and a crown group age of some (88-)85(-82) million years before present, while Magallón and Castillo (2009) estimated ages of ca 71.6 and 71.7 million years for relaxed and constrained penalized likelihood datings for the divergence of crown Celastrales, 98.6 and 98.9 million years (relaxed and constrained estimates again) for stem Celastrales (Celastrales are sister to Malpighiales).</ns1:evolution>
    <ns2:morphology xmlns:ns2="http://apweb.info/sw/ont/">Chemistry, Morphology, etc. For possible additional synapomorphies of this clade, see Matthews and Endress (2005b, 2006). For instance, there is distinctive postgenital carpel closure by conspicuously elongated cells, and functionally imperfect flowers are common. All Celastrales are basically synascidiate and have quincuncial calyx aestivation.</ns2:morphology>
    <ns3:phylogenetics xmlns:ns3="http://apweb.info/sw/ont/">Phylogeny. Huaceae were placed in this area by Nandi et al. (1998), and as sister to rest of Celastrales (inc. Lepidobotryaceae, when in the analysis), but with only moderate support, by Savolainen et al. (2000a, b); they were, however, not obviously close at all in Simmons et al. (2001 - Lepidobotryaceae not included) and were placed sister to Oxalidales with moderate support in Zhang and Simmons (2006; see also Soltis et al. 2011, etc.).</ns3:phylogenetics>

    <ns6:morphology xmlns:ns6="http://apweb.info/sw/ont/">Chemistry, Morphology, etc. Ruptiliocarpon, at least, has distinctive spirotriterpenoids unique to flowering plants (Asim et al. 2010). There is no evidence other than morphology (articulation, stipels) that the apparently simply leaves are really unifoliate, and are derived from compound leaves. Dahlgren (1988) suggested that the vessel elements have scalariform perforation plates, but they are simple; scalariform pitting is found between vessels and rays. The pits of Ruptiliocarpon are vestured (Mennega 1993).</ns6:morphology>

    <ns9:taxonRelationships xmlns:ns9="http://apweb.info/sw/ont/">Previous Relationships. Hutchinson (1973) also included Sarcotheca and Dapania (here in Oxalidaceae) with Lepidobotrys, and the leaves of Lepidobotrys are indeed superficially like those of Oxalidaceae, although differing in the stipel and paired stipules. However, the funicular obturator, septicidal capsule, etc., separates Lepidobotrys from Oxalidaceae; furthermore, the sieve tube plastids of Lepidobotrys are the common starch type. Cronquist (1981) included Lepidobotrys in Oxalidaceae, and Takhtajan (1997) placed Leipodoboryaceae and Oxalidaceae alone in his Oxalidales, while suggesting that Ruptiliocarpon - then quite recently described - was rather different, and might even be meliaceous.</ns9:taxonRelationships>
